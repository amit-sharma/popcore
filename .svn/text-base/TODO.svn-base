 make the item suggestions people centric---show lists of people first
have a loader intermediate page that comes up once a user joins from facebook auth--too slow otherwise
make sure ids match for a user, ids in auth_user, base_userprofile and others 
 
 
 ERRORS:
 Sometimes urllib throws a "read timeout" error. Check for that, especially when a new user logs in.
 With nginx server, facebook/connect.php throws a 404 not found error.
